# Charter proposal for a LOOPS WG, version 0.5

## Background

The Internet has a long history of employing performance enhancing
proxies (PEPs, RFC 3135) to improve performance over paths with links
of varying quality.  Today's PEPs often interact deeply and
"transparently" (intrusively) with end-to-end transport and
application layer protocols.  This practice is coming to an end with
increasing deployment of encryption.

At the same time, networks are becoming more complex, and
network nodes are becoming more powerful.  It is becoming more viable
to trade processing power in network nodes against path quality, in
particular for expensive path segments.  Transport protocols and their
implementations are moving towards playing better with forwarding node
functions such as ECN marking and AQM.

## LOOPS

LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) attempts to capture
opportunities opened by these developments, enabling optimizations
within some segments of an end-to-end path.  Typically, these segments will be delimited
as tunnels maintained by dedicated overlay nodes (tunnel endpoints), which allows a local
optimization protocol to run between these nodes.  Many end-to-end
flows can be aggregated into each such tunnel flow being optimized.

Initially, LOOPS will focus on path segments that do not include
either end host.  Also, multipath forwarding will not be specifically
addressed and is left for future consideration.

The selection of the segments to be optimized and the nodes that will
run LOOPS optimization is deployment-specific and is out of scope;
the assumption is that this will be performed as part of the network
configuration, which can also supply further parameters controlling
LOOPS.

The functions to be addressed by LOOPS include:

* Local recovery:  Packet losses on the path segments are recovered
  autonomously, removing the need to burden the entire end-to-end path
  with the recovery, and decreasing the latency by which these
  recoveries can be effected.  The protocol will be designed so that
  local recovery can be based on forward error correction (FEC) and/or
  (non-persistent) retransmission.  The initial focus will be on
  retransmission, but at least one FEC scheme will be included in
  order to exercise the protocol mechanisms for selecting FEC and a
  specific FEC scheme.

* Local measurement: To properly parameterize the LOOPS algorithms
  (e.g., RTO, FEC rate) and to trigger state transitions, measurements
  are continuously performed of
  the path segment between the tunnel endpoints.

* Interaction with end-to-end congestion control:  Based on
  configuration and measurement information, losses can possibly be
  categorized into congestion and non-congestion losses.  As well as
  Congestion Experienced (CE) events on the path, the losses that cannot be positively
  identified as non-congestion losses are relayed as congestion events
  to the end-to-end congestion control. Initially, LOOPS will focus on
  the use of ECN for this and therefore only supports ECN-enabled
  end-to-end flows.  Circuit breakers (RFC 8084) will be employed on
  the LOOPS tunnel to further protect against congestion collapse.

The LOOPS protocol will need to run embedded into a tunneling
protocol.  Initially, this will be Geneve (Generic Network
Virtualization Encapsulation, NVO3 WG).  To facilitate future support of
further encapsulations, LOOPS will be defined with
a separation in mind between a generic information model level, and a
set of protocol bindings that will start out as the Geneve embedding.

## Relationship to IRTF RGs

LOOPS will actively consult ICCRG, for congestion control issues, and
NWCRG, for FEC encoding and encapsulation issues.  In particular,
documents of the latter will serve as a basis for the FEC-based
components of LOOPS.

## Relationship to IETF WGs

In addition to NWCRG mentioned above, TSVWG will be consulted with
respect to their FEC-related work.
(TSVWG and TCPM will also be important sources of information on
recent developments on mechanisms used in LOOPS itself, such as ECN,
time-based recovery, as well as, with QUIC and AVTcore, on the
characteristics of end-to-end transport flows.)
LOOPS will interact (in a user role) with NVO3 as the home of
the Geneve tunneling protocol.

## Milestones

The main deliverable will be a LOOPS specification (one or split
between two documents, to be decided by the WG).
Also, the working group will adopt a "problems and opportunities"
document as the basis of this work; this document then does not
necessarily need to be published by itself as an RFC.
